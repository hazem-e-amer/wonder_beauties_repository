# wonder_beauties

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The application starts loading from splash page, then it moves to categories page if you have previously logged in. Otherwise, it will move to login page where the user logs in with one of the following accounts:
1- UN: hazem1
P: 1234561
2- UN: hazem2
P: 1234562
3- UN: hazem3
P: 1234563
With the possibility of activating the option to keep the account information to facilitate logging in after logging out of the application, in addition to the ability to use the fingerprint to log in.
On categories page, the categories are displayed, and if you click on one of these categories, you will be taken to products page.
On products page, the products related to the category chosen by the user are displayed on categories page, with the possibility of changing the category through filters on this page.
If you click on one of the products on products page, you will be taken to product details page.
On product details page, the details of the product chosen by the user are displayed on this page.
